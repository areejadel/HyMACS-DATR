# Lecture on Backpropagation in Neural Networks

## 1. Introduction

Backpropagation is a widely used method for training feedforward neural networks. It is a gradient-based algorithm that allows information to flow from the output layer back through the hidden layers, in order to compute the gradient of the cost function with respect to the network's parameters. This process is called backpropagation, and it is often simply called backprop.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before we dive into backpropagation, let's review some foundational concepts:

- The forward propagation process:
  - The network receives an input $ x $.
  - The information is propagated up through the hidden units at each layer.
  - An output $ y $ is produced.
  - The forward propagation process can be described by the following equation:
    $$ y = f(\sigma(W_1 x + b_1) \cdot W_2) $$
  - where:
    - $ W_1 $ and $ b_1 $ are the weights and biases of the first hidden layer.
    - $ W_2 $ and $ b_2 $ are the weights and biases of the output layer.
    - $ f(z) $ is the activation function applied to the weighted sum $ z $.
    - $ \sigma(z) $ is the sigmoid function.

## 3. Intuition

We can think of backpropagation as a way to adjust the weights and biases of each hidden unit in order to minimize the error between the predicted output $ y $ and the actual output $ y $.

## 4. Formal Definition and Derivation

During the training process, the network is exposed to a set of inputs and corresponding outputs. The backpropagation algorithm allows the information from the cost function to flow backwards through the network, in order to compute the gradient of the cost function with respect to the network's parameters.

$$ \delta = f'(y) \cdot g(z) $$

where:
- $ \delta $ is the error signal.
- $ f'(y) $ is the derivative of the activation function.
- $ g(z) $ is the derivative of the cost function with respect to the input $ z $.
- $ y $ is the output of the network.

## 5. Cross-Domain Application: Finance

In the field of finance, backpropagation has been used to optimize the parameters of neural networks that predict stock prices. By adjusting the weights and biases of the hidden units, the network can learn to predict the movement of stock prices more accurately. This application of backpropagation in finance demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be used to make predictions in a domain where traditional statistical methods may not be as effective.

## 6. Cross-Domain Application: Robotics

Backpropagation has also been used in the field of robotics to optimize the control parameters of a robot. By adjusting the weights and biases of the hidden units, the robot can learn to perform complex tasks more effectively. This application of backpropagation in robotics demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be used to improve the performance of physical systems.

## 7. Fully Worked Example

Let's walk through a step-by-step example of backpropagation for a simple neural network with one hidden layer.

1. For the output layer:
   - Compute the predicted output $ y $ using the forward propagation equation.
   - Compute the error signal $ \delta $ using the backpropagation equation.

2. For each hidden unit:
   - Compute the error signal $ \delta $ for the current hidden unit using the backpropagation equation.
   - Adjust the weights and biases of the hidden unit using the error signal $ \delta $.

By using backpropagation, we can adjust the weights and biases of each hidden unit in order to minimize the error between the predicted output $ y $ and the actual output $ y $. This process allows the network to learn to make more accurate predictions over time.
